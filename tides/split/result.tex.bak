\subsection{Result}
In this subsection, we introduce the result of reconstruction by
showing the power spectra, the correlation coefficient, the bias 
and the noise of reconstructed density field $\kappa$.\\

Here, the correlation coefficient of reconstructed density field
 $\kappa$ and dark matter density field defined as 
\begin{equation}
r_{\mathrm{r}}(k)=\frac{P_{\kappa\delta}(k)}{\sqrt{P_{\delta \delta}(k)P_{\kappa \kappa}(k)}},
\label{equ:r}
\end{equation}
the bias factor  
\begin{equation}
b_{\mathrm{r}}(k)=\frac{P_{\kappa\delta}(k)}{P_{\delta \delta}(k)},
\label{equ:bias_kappa}
\end{equation}
and the noise
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_{n}(k)=P_{\kappa\kappa}(k)-b^2_{\mathrm{r}}(k)P_{\delta \delta}(k).
\label{equ:noise_kappa}
\end{equation}

%===========================================================
In Fig. \ref{fig:recon_PS}, we show the auto-correlation power spectra
 of reconstructed kappa and dark matter density field and the 
kappa-matter cross power spectrum is also plotted.
  Here, we reconstruct with halos number density as 
  $0.0024\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ and the subscript 
$\kappa$ is the reconstructed large-scale density field 
$\hat{\kappa}$ which has corrected bias and convolved Wiener filter 
by Eq. \ref{eq:kappa}, the $\delta$ indicates the 
original dark matter density field.
The high errors on the first two $k$ bins is because of the sample variance.
And we find on large scales ($k<0.1 h/\mathrm{Mpc}$), $P_{\delta \kappa}$ and 
$P_{\kappa \kappa}$ almost have the same shape with $P_{\delta \delta}$. 
Then the power of $P_{\delta \kappa}$ and $P_{\kappa \kappa}$ drop quickly.
The almost coincidence of $P_{\delta \kappa}$ and $P_{\kappa \kappa}$ here
is because of the Wiener filter in Eq. \ref{eq:kappa}.
%==============

In Fig. \ref{fig:recon_CC}, we show the 
correlation coefficients (see Eq. \eqref{equ:r})
of reconstructed density field $\kappa$
and dark matter density field $\delta$ . 
Here we choose the number density of halos fields as
 $0.0012\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, $0.0024\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ 
and $0.0048\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ 
(here, the Fig. \ref{fig:recon_PS} is corresponding to the green 
dash-dotted line)
and apply a smoothing kernel with $R=1.0\ \mathrm{Mpc}/h$ 
(Eq. \eqref{equ:smooth kernel}).
We also plot the correlation coefficient of the reconstruction
from halos fields with number density of $0.0003\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$,
 which is the average number density of BOSS{\color{red} cite here}.
 For the highest number-density ($0.0048\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$)
  reconstruction, the correlation coefficient $r_{\mathrm{r}}$ 
  is larger than $0.9$ in almost all $k<0.1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$.
  What's more, even for the $0.0003\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ number-density
  halos, the reconstruction can also obtain a result of $r_{\mathrm{r}}>0.5$
  in nearly all $k<0.1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$.
  Obviously, lower number-density halos means less information about dark
  matter and lead to the loss of correlation coefficient. And the errors
  also increase with the dropping of halos number density.
  {\color{red} should mention the number density of MGS here?}

%================
The cosmic tidal reconstruction recover the information lies at small
scales and the long wavelength modes contribute little
 \citep{2012PhRvD..85d3016B,2016PhRvD..93j3504Z}. So if we apply a 
high-pass filter to remove the large-scale modes (here, we remove the modes
where $k<0.1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) of halos fields in Fourier space, the 
reconstruction of high-pass filtered halos fields should only lose little.
In Fig. \ref{fig:recon_cut}, on the top panel: we plot the 
with and without high-pass filtered halos power spectra 
$P^{k>0.1}_{hh}$ and $P_{hh}$, respectively. And the power spectrum of 
reconstructed density fields from high-pass filtered halos fields
 $P_{\kappa\kappa}^{k>0.1}$ is shown in green dotted line. Here,
 the $P_{\delta\delta}$ (the black thin solid line)
  is the power of original dark matter density fields.
 All the power spectrum is divided by the square of bias factor
 between dark matter to compare together.
 We see only with the small-scale density fluctuation 
 (the red thick solid line) can we reconstruct the large scale density
 field (the green dotted line). Here, the first point of $P^{k>0.1}_{hh}$
 is because this $k$-bin includes modes both which are removed by 
 high-pass filter and which are not removed.
 On the bottom panel: the $r^{\mathrm{all}}$ and $r^{k>0.1}$ indicate 
 the correlation coefficients of dark matter and reconstructed density field
 by halos and high-pass filtered halos fields, respectively.
We find even reconstruct without the large-scale 
($k<0.1\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$) modes of halos can also obtain a result as good 
as we do with all $k$ modes. It matches the discussion 
previous.\\

$0.0024\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ and $0.0012\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$,

\subsection{bias and noise}
As in \ref{property_h}, we analyse the result of reconstruction by the bias 
factor (defined in Eq. \ref{equ:bias_kappa}) and the noise
 (defined in Eq. \ref{equ:noise_kappa}) of reconstructed density fields.\\

Fortunately, in halos view, it is not necessary to take the 
effect of Gaussianization into account and we can try to
quantify the bias because of the estimator. When we calculate the 
bias, the Wiener filter and the Gaussian smoothing kernel should be 
involved in $Q$ factor (in Eq. \eqref{equ:Q}) and the bias because of halos
 and dark matter $b_{h}$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:Sim_bias})
  also need to be corrected.

Because of the smoothing kernel we used in Eq. \eqref{equ:smooth kernel}
and the Wiener filter in Eq. \eqref{eq:nbar_filter}, 
the $Q$ factor becomes:
\begin{equation}
Q=\int \frac{2k^{2}dk}{15\pi^{2}}W_{h}^{2}(k)S^2(k)f^{2}(k),
\label{equ:Q2}
\end{equation}
Here, we solve the $Q$ factor
by integrating from the fundamental frequency to the Nyquist frequency  
in the box of simulations.\\
Then the Eq. \eqref{equ:bias_kappa} becomes
\begin{equation}
b_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{P_{\kappa\delta}}{P_{\delta \delta}} 
\frac{1}{b_{h}^{2}Q}.
\label{equ:b_recon}
\end{equation}


In Fig. \ref{fig:recon_bias}, we show the isotropic bias factor 
$b_{\mathrm{r}}$ of reconstructed density fields from three different 
number-density halos fields.
The dashed, the dash-dotted and the dotted line is corresponding to the 
number density of $0.0012\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$,
 $0.0024\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ and $0.0048\ h^{3}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$,
 respectively. In these number density, the bias of reconstruction is 
 about $3 \sim 5$ on large scales.
 
 
The noise of reconstructed density field is plotted in 
Fig. \ref{fig:recon_noise}.
